This report includes an overview of three important classes of Model Order Reduction (MOR) approach: reduced basis methods, proper orthogonal decomposition, and proper generalized decomposition.  Also included is a discussion of techniques for data assimilation, taken from the context of numerical weather prediction, and how these techniques overlap with MOR.  Of particular interest for \nep\ are methods capable of addressing nonlinear problems and so some attention is drawn to the treatment of nonlinear effects in numerical weather prediction.

The report contains also some initial suggestion of how the techniques described might be applied in the initial \papp\ stage of \nep; however, a fuller discussion and more detailed conclusions have to be deferred until the outputs of the defrayed MOR grant have been received.
