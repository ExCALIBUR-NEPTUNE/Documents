This report surveys the textbook and standards literature regarding the documents
that should be produced as part of a major software development.
The focus is on documents that should be produced before development
starts, and on living documents that may require amendment as the development proceeds.
The documents serve to define a software development process that is provisional
in that it awaits confirmation from grantee reports. The key infrastructure 
for the next step of \nep\ is expected  to be web-based, and an investigation
into the suitability of the \F{PANDOC} tool for generating web-based material
is reported.
