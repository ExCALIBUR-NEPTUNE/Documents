%\item[2.1] {\large{}\textbf{ANTICIPATED OUTPUTS/RESULTS}}

%The anticipated outputs and results for each Task outlined in section 1.3 should 
%contain (at least): 

\begin{itemize}
\item[2.1.1] \textbf{Task 1 }

\item[$\bullet$] \Papp \ as described in section 1.3.1. 

\item[$\bullet$] Report describing work performed for Task 1 (section 1.3.1) and results 
indicating accuracy, efficiency and scalability of the approach(es) deployed in 
the \Papp (s) and recommendations for a roadmap for the solver leading to the 
full \nep \   model/code. 

\item[2.1.2] \textbf{Task 2 }

\item[$\bullet$] \Papp \ as described in section 1.3.2. 

\item[$\bullet$] Report describing work performed for Task 2 and results around accuracy, 
efficiency and scalability of the method (especially around how the UQ method will 
likely scale in terms of performance and accuracy to the eventual full \nep \   
model/code(s)). 

\item[2.1.3] \textbf{Task 3 }

\item[$\bullet$] \Papp \ as described in section 1.3.3. 

\item[$\bullet$] Report describing work performed for Task 3 and results around accuracy, 
efficiency and scalability of the method. 

\item[2.1.4] \textbf{Task 4 }

\item[$\bullet$] \Papp \ as described in Section 1.3.4. 

\item[$\bullet$] Report describing work performed for Task~4 and results around accuracy, 
efficiency and scalability of the method together with consolidated/adjusted requirements 
for the eventual full code(s). 

\item[2.1.5] \textbf{Task 5 }

\item[$\bullet$] \Papp \  as described in Section 1.3.5. 

\item[$\bullet$] Report describing work performed for Task 5 and results indicating usability, 
accuracy, efficiency and scalability of the code and approach including recommendations 
for a roadmap leading to the full \nep \   model/code beyond this call.
