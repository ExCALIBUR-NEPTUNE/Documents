\begin{enumerate}
\item Augmentation of a suitable library such as Nekmesh with capabilities to
produce grids suitable for tackling specifically plasma physics issuess
(eg.\ X-point geometry and other divertor configurations).
\item Demonstration that such a library is capable of meshing
surfaces to the required degree of accuracy, viz.\ $0.1^{o}$
in normal direction using of order~$10\,000$\, elements/square~metre.
\item Augmentation of a library such as Nektar++ with capabilities to
support solution of specifically plasma physics issues,
to be co-designed with other members of the \exc \ \nep \ community,
but recognising the needs of pre-existing library users
\item Demonstration of the capabilities of such a library in modelling
edge plasma physics, eg.\ by producing \papp s, perhaps also as 
part of a response to other elements of this \nep\ call.
\item \Papp\  as described in Objectives section
\end{enumerate}

The Bidder's response should prioritise demonstration of the capabilities
of existing and augmented software to handle the critical issues raised
by extreme surface accuracy, sonic outflow to surfaces and
large volume particle sources.
