\begin{enumerate}
\item Document describing documentation standards for the project,
with a section contrasting choices made different from UK Met Office
\item Document describing testing framework for the project,
with a section contrasting choices made different from UK Met Office
\item Design of repository structure (repository or subdirectories of repository)
to contain project files, initially populated with above documents
\item Tools to assist in the production of consistent documentation
and ease production of test cases. These may be multi-provenance, ie.\
selected from existing
software, represent modification of such tools or be specially written
\item  Design of repository structure to contain information
and other input and output data needed for testing software developed under \nep ,
especially \papp s, and including multi-provenance software for
pre- and post-processing, initially populated with results of at least one \papp .
\item Design of repository structure to contain
software developed under \nep\ especially \papp s, with capability to
produce executables, initially populated with at least one \papp .
\item Training material for documentation standards and the testing framework
\end{enumerate}

(Access to UK Met Office repositories may be arranged through \exc if needed.)
