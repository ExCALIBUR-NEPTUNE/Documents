Different workers from different UK institutions will be working on \nep .
The objective is to help them develop software of the highest quality,
with emphasis on the production of documentation and reproducible,
searching tests for the code.
Since development may transfer between institutions, it is important
that common standards for documentation and testing be available.
The software particularly in the \papp s may be written in a range
of languages including python, C++ and object Fortran (and C++ and Fortran
may use C and Fortran~77 subroutines).
There should be no indication upon inspecting the source of the software as to where
it was produced (although of course ancillary logs should include a history of
the development). Tests should be repeatable by different workers
without the need for re-training and/or any possible confusion as
to procedures and metrics needed to declare a test successful.

The development of \papp s will give focus to the task. These will 
generate a need for a documentation and testing framework, which the task 
will demonstrate is fulfilled by application to one of more \papp s.
UK Met Office has standards for documentation and testing that
should be contrasted with those developed for \nep .
