This report identifies software design patterns for use by specific \nep\ \papp s, with reference to existing C++ and Fortran simulation codes.  
The C++ language is represented here by the {\it Nektar++} and {\it BOUT++} frameworks; the Fortran language by the GS2 gyrokinetics code and the \F{SMARDDA} modules framework.
A further discussion of overarching design issues for integration of the \papp s into a multiscale, multiphysics framework follows. 
One annex gives an indication of the design process in the context of game engine software, expected
to possess comaprable or greater complexity than \nep.
The second  annex gives an overview of 
an existing set of standards for exascale \papp s, developed by the US Exascale Computing Project.
