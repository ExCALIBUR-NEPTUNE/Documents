As discussed in the Year One Summary Report~\cite{y1re121}, spectral elements are desirable on
grounds of accuracy. 
Consideration and discussions have indicated that the accuracy of the spectral element approach
can be maintained in complex geometries provided surfaces are meshed to a sufficiently
high degree of accuracy. Producing such meshes can be challenging, but recent developments (Nekmesh)
based around the spectral/hp element library Nektar++ are showing promise that these
challenges can be met. Resource should be directed to ensuring that this emergent capability
can handle PFC and other geometries relevant to the tokamak edge.
