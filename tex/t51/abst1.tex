This report collates technical material used to inform the preparation of the call for
procurement of support for Uncertainty Quantification~(UQ).
The work performed primarily consisted of collating material produced
internally by UKAEA and by external grantees at UCL, plus
hands-on exploration of sampling techniques, the construction of surrogates and the study
of dimensionally reduced models. In addition, information from Exeter contractors
gathered at \nep \ workshops is included. Besides paying for contractors, UKAEA is also 
sponsoring a PhD in UQ which is described in order to avoid duplication. The
report has been slightly delayed so that it could be updated with material from
a second \nep \ UQ workshop on 30 June, in order
to facilitate assessment of bids for grants for the \nep \ 2021 call.
