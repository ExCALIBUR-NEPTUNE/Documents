\subsection{General Considerations}\label{sec:considers}
It is important that individual
units of code are manageable and the overall structure is comprehensible,
so that developers and users can navigate the codebase and determine where new work is to be located.
This simple consideration implies that \nep\ software
should be divided into units that it will be convenient to refer
to as modules,
sections of code containing everything necessary to perform one (and only one)
aspect of the desired functionality.

The suggested content of a module
describing a single class in the UML sense (see \Sec{lowlevel}, \Tab{umltrans})
implies a minimum of $13$~methods described by separate Fortran subroutines,
with examples extending up to $50$, although the latter is there regarded as an excessively large
number of methods..
Many small software libraries also fall into this size range.
Supposing that each subroutine is of a length to fit within one computer window, ie.\
up to about~$60$~lines, the desirable maximum length of a well-designed module file is
$30\times60 = 1\,800$~lines which is a manageable size of file given 
editing software that remembers on restart, the last line accessed (so that it possible
to return immediately to a particular subroutine).
The magnitude of the D3.3 exercise follows from
the fact that comparable software packages probably of somewhat lesser complexity
than \nep\ written in high level languages such as C++ range in size up to~$1\,000\,000$ lines.
Clearly $400$~separate modules is too unwieldy, and there is a need to organise
further into packages which might contain in turn $10$-$50$ modules. 
As a way of providing further indication to developers,
it is helpful to talk of packages as being arranged into layers, as discussed
in ref~\cite[\S\S\,2.4,3.2]{y2re333}, see \Fig{hierarchygroup}.
Then, as prefigured in ref~\cite[Annex~A]{y2re333}, it is possible to encapsulate
the necessary complexity in one, albeit large diagram.

\subsection{Considerations for Scientific Software}\label{sec:scistruct}
\subsubsection{Structural Considerations}\label{sec:structure}
In both refs~\cite{y1re331,y2re332}, a figure from Dubey~et~al~\cite{Du16Idea} is reproduced
that illustrates how scientific software may be developed by beginning with an ``infrastructure"
capability into which initially exploratory scientific software is integrated as its worth
is established. Unfortunately for \nep, it is not clear initially what  aspects  of the infrastructure
will be durable and stable, although once the software is more mature, Dubey~et~al's methodology
appears attractive.

The literature referenced in ref~\cite{y2re333} and indeed the local practice of the \F{SMARDDA} development
indicates that scientific software should be produced by aggregation, but are less
helpful as to what is to be aggregated, i.e.\ the modular decomposition as to what should
constitute a single module etc. Surprisingly little detailed discussion was found in the literature
after the early book by Booch~\cite{booch}, as to how to create classes in
the scientific and engineering context, with the exception of Douglass~\cite[\S\,5]{douglass}.
The ideal would be a way to create classes that enabled rapid development  of code
that executed efficiently but was easily re-used.
%where flexibility is also an important consideration,
Douglass~\cite[\S\,5]{douglass} does not specifically address these last points, but they
could guide choice of objects in his approach which is reproduced as Appendix~\Sec{objdisc}.

The \nep\ development will proceed as a series of \papp s. Thus there is a chance
to refine and redefine an initial modular decomposition with each successive \papp,
recording the results as a UML structure diagram. When generating the corresponding
sequence diagram (i.e.\ procedural description), the \papp-based units should be preserved to
facilitate the use of the simpler ones as surrogates for the later more complex \papp s.

To help understand the  aggregation of the software, it should be layered in the obvious manner,
with the higher layers corresponding to greater numbers of aggregated objects. It is also expected
to be useful to classify the modules.
The modules should be arranged into a relatively small number of packages according to, for example,
whether they treat
geometry generation, matrix coefficient calculation, the main matrix solution, or visualisation.

\subsubsection{Interactions between Modules}\label{sec:modulint}
Concerning logical interconnections between modules, the 
use of  a directed, acyclic graph~(DAG) structure might be thought mandatory,
particularly to  process the input
data in order to specify coherently the construction of the elements of the solution matrix.
However, as prefigured in ref~\cite{y2re333} for the gyrokinetics code \F{GS2}, the tightly coupled nature of the central edge
physics problem  means that input is more about gathering \emph{all} the data, for only at that point
can fields be computed and only after that may matrix coefficients be computed.
