This report provides a discussion for the \nep\ project
of both very high-level and very low-level options for the basic module structure,
together with input/output and fine-scale data structures.
It complements the description provided by the previous milestone
reports~\cite{y1re331,y2re332,y2re333}.
This report completes D3.3 to produce a background against which final decisions may be taken
regarding decomposition of \nep\ software into modules,
and the grouping of modules into packages. It recommends use of the
Unified Modeling Language~(UML~2) to describe software structure.
