Data from the Tore Supra tokamak show striking similarities in the shape of these intermittent events as well as the fluctuation density probability distribution and frequency spectrum. The fact that intermittent, large-scale events are so similar in linear devices and tokamaks indicates the universality of convective transport in magnetically confined plasmas. }

We discuss the possible role of the clustering in the physics of atmospheric aerosols, in particular, in cloud formation.

The parameter dependences of the generated transport barriers as well as third order bifurcations will be discussed numerically and analytically in the present paper. First, using a Galerkin representation, bifurcating states (from the conductive states in a rectangular cell) are investigated for the cases when only one unstable mode dominates. The dependence of the bifurcation properties on the aspect ratio of the domain is discussed, leading to the conclusion that for vanishing (or small) magnetic shear the so called L-H-ELM (low-high-edge localized mode) transitions do not occur for small aspect ratios of the domain. Including reasonable magnetic shear, the small-aspect-ratio cut-off disappears, and transport barriers may exist in a broad parameter range. Secondly, for small aspect ratios, interesting codimension-2 bifurcations occur. When unfolding the dynamics up to third order, e.g. a weakly nonlinear interaction of convection cells is observed. The analytical result are confirmed by numerical simulations.}

The confinement variations are linked to two distinct regulation mechanisms which are also shown to be at the origin of low-frequency bursting in the fluctuation level and the convective heat flux integral, both resulting in a state of large-scale intermittency. The first one involves the control of convective transport by sheared mean flows. This regulation relies on the conservative transfer of kinetic energy from tilted fluctuations to the mean component of the flow. Bursting can also result from the quasi-linear modification of the linear instability drive which is the mean pressure gradient. For each bursting process the relevant zero-dimensional model equations are given. These are finally coupled in a minimal model of convection in fluids and plasmas. The results of the modeling are used to discuss confinement scaling and intermittency, and in a heuristic way, more complex issues such as criticality and transport avalanches.}

The skewness (i.e., asymmetry of fluctuations from the average) of probe and BES intermittent data suggest IPO formation at or near the last closed flux surface (LCFS) and the existence of hole-IPO pairs. The particle content of the IPOs at the LCFS is linearly dependent on the discharge density, however, when normalized to the local averaged density, it is fairly insensitive to density variations. It is also shown that the IPOs thermalize with the background plasma within 1 cm of the LCFS. The IPOs appear in the SOL of both L and H mode discharges carrying ~50% of the total SOL radial E * BT transport at all radii. However, the total flux and the IPO contribution, are highly reduced in H-mode conditions due to the increased confinement}

  annote = 	 {We present the results of a series of high-resolution, three-dimensional numerical experiments that investigate the nature of turbulent compressible convective motions extending from a convection zone into a stable layer below. In such convection, converging flows in the near-surface cellular convecting network create strong down owing plumes that can traverse the multiple scale heights of the convection zone. Such structures can continue their downward motions beyond the convecting region, piercing the stable layer, where they are decelerated by buoyancy braking. If these motions mix entropy to an adiabatic state below the convection zone, the process is known as penetration; otherwise it is termed overshooting. We find that in three-dimensional turbulent compressible convection at the parameters studied, motions generally overshoot a significant fraction of the local pressure scale height but do not establish an adiabatic penetrative region, even at the highest Peclet numbers considered. This is mainly due to the low filling factor of the turbulent plumes. The scaling of the overshooting depth with the relative stability S of the two layers is affected by this lack of true penetration. Only an S-1 dependence is exhibited, reflecting the existence of a thermal adjustment region without a nearly adiabatic penetration zone. Rotation about a vertical axis decreases the depth of overshooting, owing to horizontal mixing induced by the rotation. For rotation about an inclined axis, turbulent rotational alignment of the strong downflow structures decreases the overshooting further at mid-latitudes, but the laminar effects of cellular roll solutions take over at low latitudes. Turbulent penetrative convection is quite distinct from its laminar counterpart and from the equivalent motions in a domain conned by impenetrable horizontal boundaries. Although overshooting would not be so deep in the solar case, the lack of true penetration extending the adiabatic region may explain why helioseismic inferences show little evidence of the expected abrupt change between the convection zone and the radiative interior. These results may also provide insight into how overshooting motions can provide a coupling between the solar convection zone and the tachocline. }

Marginal stability is a special case of the more general phenomenon of self-organized criticality. Simple, one field models of the dynamics of tokamak plasma self-organized criticality have been constructed, and include relevant features such as sheared mean flow and transport bifurcations. In such models, slow mode (i.e., large-scale, low-frequency transport events) correlation times determine the behavior of transport dynamics near marginal stability. To illustrate this, impulse response scaling exponents (z) and turbulent diffusivities (D) have been calculated for the minimal (Burgers') and sheared flow models. For the minimal model, z=1 (indicating ballistic propagation) and D~(S)1/3, where S is the noise strength. With an identically structured noise spectrum and flow with shearing rate exceeding the ambient decorrelation rate for the largest-scale transport events, diffusion is recovered with z=2 and D~(S)3/5. This indicates a qualitative change in the dynamics, as well as a reduction in losses. These results are consistent with recent findings from dimensionless scaling studies. Several tokamak transport experiments are suggested.}

The application of the methods of statistical mechanics to the description of the motion of fluid particles, i.e., to the Lagrangian dynamics, has led to a new quantitative theory of intermittency in turbulent transport. The first analytical description of anomalous scaling laws in turbulence has been obtained. The underlying physical mechanism reveals the role of statistical integrals of motion in nonequilibrium systems. For turbulent transport, the statistical conservation laws are hidden in the evolution of groups of fluid particles and arise from the competition between the expansion of a group and the change of its geometry. By breaking the scale-invariance symmetry, the statistically conserved quantities lead to the observed anomalous scaling of transported fields. Lagrangian methods also shed new light on some practical issues, such as mixing and turbulent magnetic dynamo. }

An analytical calculation shows that magnetic field curvature and thermodiffusion drive an anomalous pinch. The curvature driven pinch velocity is consistent with the prediction of turbulence equipartition theory. The thermodiffusion flux is found to be directed inward for a small ratio of electron to ion pressure gradient, and it reverses its sign when increasing this ratio. Numerical simulations confirm that a turbulent particle pinch exists. It is mainly driven by curvature for equal ion and electron heat sources. The sign and relative weights of the curvature and thermodiffusion pinches are consistent with the analytical calculation. }

Furthermore, the scaling of the ion thermal diffusivity is not always consistent with local gyro-Bohm-like transport but rather scales worse than Bohm-like. This work is an attempt to reconcile these observations with simplified numerical simulations of toroidal ion temperature gradient (ITG) mode turbulence using a fast two-dimensional (2-D) inhomogeneous full radius turbulence code. It is found that action at a distance is possible, but only at weak damping rates, since the propagation range is given simply by the curvature drift group velocity divided by the average damping rate. The correlation lengths always scale linearly with the gyroradius. It is found that Bohm scaling or worse is possible when the gradients are close to the ITG threshold and the radial modes keep the turbulence level small enough to avoid destroying the slow to form global eigenmodes. In contrast to local ITG ballooning modes, the global eigenmode growth rates decrease with increasing gyroradius from the effect of larger diamagnetic rotational shear. This behavior results in an increase of the correlation time with increasing gyroradius, when the gradients are close to the thresholds. Thus, at sufficiently large relative gyroradius, the breaking of gyro-Bohm scaling can result from increased stability not mixing length.}

A single model equation for the local turbulence intensity, I (x , t ), includes the
effects of local linear growth and damping, spatially local nonlinear coupling
to dissipation and spatial scattering of turbulence energy induced by nonlinear
coupling. In the absence of dissipation, front propagation into the linearly stable
zone occurs with the property of rapid progression at small t, followed by slower
sub-diffusive progression at late times. The turbulence radial spreading into the
linearly stable zone reduces the turbulent intensity in the linearly unstable zone

intensity and the transport scaling. These are in broad, semi-quantitative
agreement with a number of global gyrokinetic simulation results with zonal
flows and without zonal flows. Front propagation stops when the radial flux

The decay in the three-way interaction occurs to smaller and larger values of /k/ (Kz wavenumber). In a region of large wavenumbers this leads to the dual cascade; the energy spectrum cascades to smaller /k/ and the enstrophy spectrum to larger /k/, similar to the case of two-dimensional Navier-Stokes turbulence. In a small wavenumber region a resonant three-wave decay process dominates the cascade process, and an anisotropic spectrum develops. As a consequence of the cascade, zonal flows in the direction perpendicular to the direction of inhomogeneity appear which presents a potential implication for the particle confinement in a turbulent plasma. }

PDFs can be re-scaled using a functional form, PDF(Gamma(ExB)) = L-1 g(Gamma(ExB)/L), where L is directly related with the level of fluctuations in the turbulent flux. This kind of re-scaling holds at different timescales in which the functional form of the PDF changes. The empirical similarity in the PDF of turbulent transport in the edge region in both the JET tokamak and the TJ-II stellarator supports the view that turbulent transport displays universality in fusion plasmas. These results emphasize the importance of the statistical description of transport processes in fusion plasmas as an alternative approach to the traditional way to characterize transport based on the computation of effective transport coefficients (i.e. diffusion coefficients) and on average quantities (i.e. average correlation lengths).}

The first H-modes, which occurred after the sudden application of neutral beam heating, appeared to result from a bifurcation of the edge transport. However, slow transitions produced, for example, by ohmic heating do not have the character of a bifurcation but appear to result from a slow and reversible change in the characteristics of the edge turbulence, which becomes increasingly intermittent as the high confinement mode is approached. The experimental results are interpreted in the light of various models of the transition process and of the type III or transition edge localized modes that accompany it. The evidence is mainly against the bifurcation hypothesis but nonlinear processes are clearly involved. The implications for the next generation of tokamaks intended to reach thermonuclear ignition are discussed}

A possible mechanism for fast convective plasma transport is related to the plasma filaments or "blobs" observed in the SOL with fast cameras and probes. In this paper, physical arguments suggesting the importance of blob transport [S. I. Krasheninnikov, Phys. Lett. A 283, 368 (2001)] have been extended by calculations using a three-field fluid model, treating the blobs as coherent propagating structures. The properties of density, temperature and vorticity blobs, and methods of averaging over ensembles of blobs to get the average SOL profiles, are illustrated. The role of ionization of background neutrals in sustaining the density blob transport is also discussed. Many qualitative features of the experiments, such as relatively flat density profiles and transport coefficients increasing toward the wall, are shown to emerge naturally from the blob transport paradigm}

At early times (i.e., within two integral times) the separation process is exponential, following Lin's law [J. T. Lin, J. Atmos. Sci. 29, 394 (1972)]. In this range of time, the probability density functions (PDFs) of separations are self-similar in time, developing stretched exponential tails, and one may define a Lagrangian correlation time. Above two integral times, an algebraic regime takes place, with exponential tails for the PDFs of the separations, and self-similar Lagrangian correlation functions. The present work thus confirms the existence of two regimes, by analyzing a number of statistical quantities including the Lagrangian PDF and the temporal Lagrangian correlation functions which so far, were left undetermined for the Batchelor regime.}

A strong external uniform magnetic field B-0 is assumed to be present orthogonal to both background shear flow and its inhomogeneity. Energy is injected into the fluid and/or magnetic field on small scales. It is shown analytically that eddy viscosity is reduced as 1/B-0(2) for a strong B-0, due to the cancellation of the Reynolds stress by Maxwell stress. The sign of eddy viscosity is found to depend on the detailed properties of forcings. Specifically, it is positive for fluid forcing but depends on the anisotropy of the forcing in the case of magnetic forcing. Furthermore, it is indicated that a magnetic field tends to laminarize a mean shear flow. The possible implication of these results for the dynamics of the zonal flows in tokamaks is discussed in view of the cancellation of stresses.}

The linear machine is surrounded by a set of 68 magnet coils which can generate an axial magnetic field of up to 3000 G. The vacuum chamber has 128 radial ports to ensure excellent access for probes and antennas. An internal probe drive capable of moving a set of probes to any position within the plasma column is described in a companion paper. This machine is a scientific instrument in its own right and was designed to be versatile enough to study a large variety of phenomena.

Observations, theories, and models of oceanic vertical mixing are surveyed, Two distinct regimes are identified: ocean mixing in the boundary layer near the surface under a variety of surface forcing conditions (stabilizing, destabilizing, and wind driven), and mixing in the ocean interior due to internal waves, shear instability, and double diffusion (arising from the different molecular diffusion rates of heat and salt). Mixing schemes commonly applied to the upper ocean are shown not to contain some potentially important boundary layer physics. Therefore a new parameterization of oceanic boundary layer mixing is developed to accommodate some of this physics. It includes a scheme for determining the boundary layer depth h, where the turbulent contribution to the vertical shear of a bulk Richardson number is parameterized. Expressions for diffusivity and nonlocal transport throughout the boundary layer are given. The diffusivity is formulated to agree with similarity theory of turbulence in the surface layer and is subject to the conditions that both it and its vertical gradient match the interior values at h. This nonlocal ''K profile parameterization'' (KPP) is then verified and compared to alternatives, including its atmospheric counterparts. Its most important feature is shown to be the capability of the boundary layer to penetrate well into a stable thermocline in both convective and wind-driven situations. The diffusivities of the aforementioned three interior mixing processes are modeled as constants, functions of a gradient Richardson number (a measure of the relative importance of stratification to destabilizing shear), and functions of the double-diffusion density ratio, R(rho). Oceanic simulations of convective penetration, wind deepening, and diurnal cycling are used to determine appropriate values for various model parameters as weak functions of vertical resolution. Annual cycle simulations at ocean weather station Papa for 1961 and 1969-1974 are used to test the complete suite of parameterizations. Model and observed temperatures at all depths are shown to agree very well into September, after which systematic advective cooling in the ocean produces expected differences. It is argued that this cooling and a steady salt advection into the model are needed to balance the net annual surface heating and freshwater input. With these advections, good multiyear simulations of temperature and salinity can be achieved. These results and KPP simulations of the diurnal cycle at the Long-Term Upper Ocean Study (LOTUS) site are compared with the results of other models. It is demonstrated that the KPP model exchanges properties between the mixed layer and thermocline in a manner consistent with observations, and at least as well or better than alternatives.}

Lin , Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 195004 (2002)]. A possible resolution to this puzzle is identified as turbulence spreading from the linearly active (unstable) region to the linearly inactive (stable) region. Large scale gyrokinetic simulations found that transport driven by microscopic fluctuations is diffusive and local, whereas the fluctuation intensity is determined by nonlocal effects. Fluctuations are found to spread from the linearly active region to the linearly inactive region. This turbulence spreading reduces the fluctuation intensity in the unstable region, especially for a smaller device size, and thus introduces a nonlocal dependence in the fluctuation intensity. The device size dependence of the fluctuation intensity, in turn, is responsible for the observed gradual transition from Bohm to gyro-Bohm transport scaling. }

Both forms of nonlinear structure can be described within the framework of the Hasegawa-Mima equation, as extended by Smolyakov et al (Smolyakov A I, Diamond P H and Malkov M 2000 Phys. Rev. Lett. 84 491), although streamers have not previously been analysed in this context. Here we present results obtained by comparing analytical weak-turbulence calculations with numerical simulations using a spectral code. The analytical results are obtained with a four-wave model, incorporating a drift wave (k2) coupled to both sidebands (k2±k1) by a zonal flow or streamer (k1). Fully nonlinear studies of this four-wave system have been carried out, and we find that analytical expressions derived from wave coupling models provide a good guide to the spectral code results. Instability conditions are found and growth rates computed, showing that zonal flows are more unstable than streamers, at least at this level of description. Typically, we find that the streamer growth rate is lower than that of the zonal flow by a factor of order sk1. Insofar as our Hasegawa-Mima model contains many of the core physics elements of more sophisticated approaches, these results are of wider importance to the numerical modelling of drift turbulence in tokamaks.}

Features that are characteristic of self-generated zonal flows are observed in the radial region 0.85less than or equal tor/aless than or equal to1.0. These features include a coherent oscillation (approximately 15 kHz) in the poloidal flow of density fluctuations that has a long poloidal wavelength, possibly m=0, narrow radial extent (k(r)rho(I)<0.2), and whose frequency varies monotonically with the local temperature. The approximate effective shearing rate, dv(theta)/dr, of the flow is of the same order of magnitude as the measured nonlinear decorrelation rate of the turbulence, and the density fluctuation amplitude is modulated at the frequency of the observed flow oscillation. Some phase coherence is observed between the higher wavenumber density fluctuations and low frequency poloidal flow fluctuations, suggesting a Reynolds stress contribution. These characteristics are consistent with predicted features of zonal flows, specifically identified as geodesic acoustic modes, observed in 3-D Braginskii simulations of core/edge turbulence.}

and poloidally asymmetric pressure perturbations due to a geodesic curvature makes the zonal flows
oscillatory in a high q region. Energy transfer from the oscillatory zonal flows to the turbulence via
the poloidally asymmetric pressure perturbations is identified. Therefore in the high q region where
the zonal flows are oscillatory, the zonal flows cannot quench the turbulence and turbulent transport
is not suppressed completely. As for the zonal flow behavior, it is favorable for confinement
improvement to make the low q region where the stationary zonal flows are dominant in tokamak

A simple model incorporating the nonlinear coupling between the turbulent fluctuations and the sheared radial electric field is added to a transport model in order to investigate the dynamics of the transition to this enhanced confinement mode. In this model, by incorporating; both the instability growth rate profiles and particle and/or power deposition profiles, a rich variety of transition dynamics is uncovered. Transition dynamics and their concomitant thresholds are examined within the context of these models. In the course of investigating these transitions, potential methods for triggering and controlling these enhanced confinement regimes have been discovered and are discussed.}

TRANSP analysis shows that transport coefficients in OMS plasmas are often reduced in the plasma core (Cottrell, G.A., et al., in Controlled Fusion and Plasma Physics (Proc. 24th fur. Conf. Berchtesgaden, 1997), Vol. 21A, Part I, European Physical Society, Geneva (1997) 81) to the level of ion neoclassical transport. TRANSP analysis and predictive modelling with JETTO show that this region of improved confinement appears near the plasma centre and then expands outwards in a way which does not follow either the evolution of the region with the negative magnetic shear or the propagation of the region with a large shear in plasma rotation. The best agreement with experiment has been achieved by using a transport model which combines the effect of a long wavelength decoupling due to small magnetic shear with its suppression by strong rotational shear. Predictive modelling of some of the characteristic JET OMS plasmas gives quite good agreement between such a model and the experimental data.

The basic statistical properties of the concentrations of the clouds are analyzed with particular attention to their space-time evolutions in the center of mass as well as the rest frames of reference. Approximate analytical expressions for the concentration and the concentration fluctuations are discussed. The cloud concentration is modeled by a multiple contour distribution, where the concentration is constant within boundaries convected by the flow. Two different types of initial releases are considered: compact, core-type distributions, and alternatively "annulus'' shaped distributions, with vanishing concentration at the center. It is demonstrated that the time evolution of the mean square radius of a cloud can be obtained solely from the power spectrum of the velocity fluctuations with a given, straightforward, model for the relative velocity correlation function. The analysis also provides results for the elongation of material lines convected by the turbulent flow, the observations confirming the expected exponential elongation for large times. }

  OPTannote = 	 {One mechanism for transport of energy and particles in a plasma is by discrete, intermittent, uncorrelated events, often called avalanches. This paper reports observations and quantitative characterization of avalanche events in a magnetically confined plasma. The observations are primarily of electron temperature fluctuations. Avalanches are identified by their large spatial scale, up to the system size, by self-similar behavior in the frequency spectrum and the autocorrelation function and by propagation. The two-point cross-correlation function allows determination of a characteristic velocity, which typically varies from several hundred meters per second in the outer part of the plasma to zero or even inward near the axis. This can be interpreted as resulting from the prevalence of negative avalanches (i.e., holes) near the axis. The presence of a long-tailed probability distribution is indicated by a Hurst parameter (H) in the range 0.80 to 0.95, which becomes smaller in the outer quarter of the plasma radius. Density fluctuation spectra from the plasma core also show self-similar behavior. Power transport estimates show that about half of the heat flux is carried by the avalanche events under conditions with no magnetohydrodynamic activity. These observations are qualitatively similar to results of modeling calculations based on drift wave turbulence. It is reasonable to infer that avalanches are the macroscopic manifestation of turbulence which inherently has a small spatial scale and, thus, allow a local, gyro-Bohm scaling process to show global Bohm-type behavior.

A detailed analysis shows that in the presence of centrally deposited ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) Ar transport is modified, in the sense of a reduction of the inward pinch convection. Sawtooth (ST) crashes also hamper the accumulation of Ar in the core, though their contribution is less relevant compared to the effect of the ICRH. The analysis is carried out by means of a one-dimensional impurity transport code, which has been applied to several Ar-seeded discharges. The result about the role of ST crashes is independent of triangularity. In the high triangularity discharges, with continuous D refuelling, the convection of impurities in the core region is typically very small so that ICRH injection itself has little relevance in the control of the Ar behaviour.}

Two different non-diffusive mechanisms that can contribute strongly to the cross-field transport in the SOL of high-density discharges are identified and compared. The first of these involves intermittent transport events that are observed at the plasma separatrix and in the SOL. Intermittence has qualitatively similar character in L-mode and ELM-free H-mode. Low-amplitude ELMs observed in high-density H-mode produce in the SOL periods with cross-field transport enhanced to L-mode levels and featuring intermittent events similar to those in L-mode. The intermittent transport events are compatible with the concept of plasma filaments propagating across the SOL due to E×B drifts. The intermittent character of the transport in the SOL is also in agreement with predictions of the non-linear numerical simulations performed with an imposed driving flux. Another type of non-diffusive transport is often seen in high-density H-modes with prolonged ELM-free periods, where the transport near the separatrix is dominated by quasi-coherent modes driving particle and/or heat fluxes exceeding L-mode levels. These modes may play an important role by providing particle and/or heat exhaust between ELMs.}

The idea that chaotic systems can in fact be controlled may be counter-intuitive; after all they are unpredictable in the long term. Nevertheless, numerous theorists have independently developed methods which can be applied to chaotic systems, and many experimentalists have demonstrated that physical chaotic systems respond well to both simple and sophisticated control strategies. The great bulk of these researchers have restricted their study to low-dimensional systems, and correspondingly we critique this work at length. Most recently, a few researchers have proposed control techniques for application to high- or infinite-dimensional systems, and we describe this work in some detail as well}

While the edge density remains constant the central density increases as does the stored energy until sawteeth are lost and impurity influx sets in. This peaking process is only observed with NBI heating. Substituting half of the heating by central ICRH leads to completely flat profiles even though half of the original NBI particle fuelling remains. This behaviour, as well as the slow timescale of the peaking process with pure NBI heating, is successfully modelled with a pinch of the order of the neoclassical Ware pinch and a proportionality between the particle diffusion coefficient D and the heat conductivity . Such an assumption links D to the heat flux profile qheat, since the temperature profile is observed to be stiff. Such a model implies flat density profiles for a centrally heated fusion reactor.}

abstract = { Flux expulsion is an important consequence of the interaction
 of magnetic fields with fluid convection and has been well studied for 
particular cases of steady, single-cell flows. Here we examine a related 
phenomenon in inhomogeneous turbulence using direct numerical simulations. 
To understand our numerical results, we analyse average properties of our 
model, and obtain mean transport coefficients which can be used to describe 
the approach of the system to its final state. For the kinematic problem 
these transport coefficients give an excellent prediction of the expulsion
 process; however, the enhanced transport is suppressed by dynamical 
back-reaction of the Lorentz force. Finally, we discuss the astrophysical 
implications for magnetic fields in stellar convection zones. Segregation 
of magnetic fields from turbulent motion not only allows strong toroidal 
fields to accumulate in regions of convective overshoot but also permits 
significant poloidal fields to be maintained by dynamo action in stars
 like the Sun. }

For RDAM it is found that the generated shear flow stabilizes the dominant modes; however, other modes are destabilized. For RWM Maxwell stress due to magnetic fluctuations has a tendency to suppress the poloidal flow near the plasma surface, which gives almost the same saturation level for different initial poloidal flows, since the shear flow stabilization disappears.}

Larger blobs are subject to the Rayleigh\x{2013}Taylor (RT) instability, which breaks the blob apart and effectively reduces the scale of new structures. Smaller blobs evolve into mushroom structures typical for nonlinear stages of the RT and Richtmyer\x{2013}Meshkov instabilities in fluids.

  annote = 	 {Trace amounts of tritium (1-5 percent of the deuterium content) were introduced in short puffs (similar to 40 ms) into the low field midplane edge of steady state deuterium plasmas in JET. The transport properties of the edge and core plasma, and the time evolution of the fraction of tritium in the recycling flux, determine the evolution in space and time of the 14 MeV neutron emission following these puffs. The derived tritium transport coefficients were used to model the deuterium density profile. Good agreement of the profile shape was found near the edge. In the core, the predicted deuterium density is more peaked than the measured profile. An attempt was made to study the scaling of tritium transport with dimensionless plasma parameters. For H mode discharges the transport is best described by gyro-Bohm scaling in the core and Bohm scaling near the edge. These conclusions are based on the assumption that the dependence of particle transport on beta and nu* is weak within the range of variation in these parameters in the data set.}

Observations associated with events such as sawtooth collapses, neo-classical tearing modes and edge localized modes are described. Tritium transport is seen to approach neo-classical levels in the plasma core at high density and low q(95), and in the transport barrier region of internal transport barrier (ITB) discharges. Tritium transport remains well above neo-classical levels in all other cases. The correlation of the measured tritium diffusion coefficient and convection velocity for normalized minor radii r/a = [0.65, 0.80] with the controllable parameters q95 and plasma density are found to be consistent for all operational regimes (ELMy H-mode discharges with or without ion cyclotron frequency resonance heating, hybrid scenario and ITB discharges). Scaling with local physics parameters is best described by gyro-Bohm scaling with an additional inverse beta dependence. }

Application of nonstandard, topological methods to describe the structural properties of the turbulent state is considered and the transition to kinetic equations in fractional derivatives for describing the microscopic behavior of a medium is examined. Central to the discussion is the concept of the percolation constant C approximate to 1.327..., a universal parameter describing the topology of nonequilibrium (quasi)stationary states in complex nonlinear dynamical systems allowing self-organized critical behavior. Much attention is given to the formation of power-law energy density spectra in turbulent media. A number of topical problems in modern cosmic electrodynamics, including the self-consistent fractal model of a turbulent current sheet, substorm dynamics, and the formation and dynamical evolution of large-scale magnetic fields in the solar photosphere and interplanetary space, are also discussed. }
