There is one objective, namely to help determine the most appropriate matrix
preconditioners for systems of equations arising in Exascale plasma
modelling. These systems are built largely by discretising transport operators
applied to spectral element bases and exploiting static condensation,
although discretised elliptic operators typically also appear.
It is expected that the complete
model system consisting of both elliptics and non-elliptics should be solved
close-coupled as suggested by the physics. Comparison with
loose-coupled solution is expected, see eg.\ ref~\cite{Fe19gene}
and if close-coupling appears infeasible,
then appropriate preconditioning techniques should be identified for loose-coupling.

Appropriateness will be determined by
\begin{itemize}
\item Robustness, perhaps as shown by mathematical proofs establishing convergence
for relevant matrices.
\item Efficiency, measured by number of iterations required and complexity of each iteration
for solution of whole system.
\item Suitability for the Exascale in terms of scaling and ease of implementation.
\end{itemize}
