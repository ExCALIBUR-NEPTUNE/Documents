\begin{enumerate}
\item Report by end FY 20/21 describing the features, capability and portability of at least the above-listed
approaches with particular reference to \nep \  algorithms. 
This should be a ``living document" capable of further updating by end FY~21/22.

\item Report by end of grant analysing the available options for performance portability, recommending 
at least one preferred approach in each of the three classes listed above for subsequent adoption,
including any desirable modifications, additions or replacements of existing approaches.

\item Report by end of grant on design patterns most suited 
to the preferred options for performance portability.

\item The bidder should indicate how, over the duration of the grant, they intend to engage
in community building and development, for example by agreeing to assist the successful bidders
to Call~T/NA078/20 and/or Call~T/NA083/20 in the production of one or more \papp s in order to impress upon the evolving
infrastructure a `separation of concerns' philosophy around instantiation through performance
portability/code generation and by DSL. Alternatively, the bidder could propose to develop their
own \papp(s) around the \exc\ \nep\ requirements especially the document~\cite{pappeqs},
in order to inform a roadmap for the project,
eg.\ to demonstrate how `separation of concerns' can be achieved when implementing particle-based methods 
at the Exascale.
%where feasible produce one or more \papp s to demonstrate key features
%of preferred approaches and at minimum assist in the production of such \papp s as part of a community effort.

%For Background:
%Successful completion of this activity will require close communication with the 
%UKAEA. As well as monthly highlight reports, we envisage that this will include 
%three meetings for the monitoring of the project [a kick off meeting (in person 
%or video-conference); a mid-term review meeting (in person); and a final meeting 
%(in person)] and at least monthly conference calls with UKAEA employees.
