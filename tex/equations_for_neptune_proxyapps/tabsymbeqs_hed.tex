\caption{\textbf{\textsf{TABLE OF MATHEMATICAL SYMBOLS}}
If no units are given, then quantity is dimensionless, or if the units are given as~$?$,
then the dimensions depend on context.
Generally, the usage of symbols tries to follow that from the Plasma Formulary~\cite{NRLpf07},
in SI units, with temperatures specified as~$kT$ which returns~$J$. The Formulary also
give the fundamental dimensions of the SI units, which should enable checking of dimensional consistency of
equations, eg.\ magnetic field induction is in Tesla~($T$) whence the fundamental
dimension expression gives~$T=kg s^{-1} C^{-1}$.
Note that the symbols are sorted by font as well as alphabet, so that boldface symbols
appear immediately after~`b' (backslashes ignored).
