The report describes equations for \exc \ project \nep \ \Papp s.  
The numbering of the systems follows that of the \nep\ Science Plan, so 
that those listed under FM-WP2 are denoted 2-1, 2-2, etc., and 
under FM-WP3 as 3-1, 3-2, etc. It is a living document to which further equation 
systems will be added throughout the course of the project.
