.. dropdown:: :doc:`TN-01_SurfaceMeshGeneration`

    This report focuses on the initial phase of work undertaken by the University of Exeter and Imperial College London to investigate challenges for generation of high-order meshes for the NEPTUNE project. The report assesses surface mesh quality attained during the high-order mesh generation process, with a particular focus on the maximum deflection angle of surface normal from the underlying CAD representation.

    This report focuses on the initial phase of work undertaken by Kingâ€™s College London and Imperial College London to investigate challenges for generation of high-order meshes for the NEPTUNE project. It extends the two-dimensional high-order mesh generation process for producing meshes for the tokamak edge region, with a particular focus on anisotropic element clustering leveraging the r-adaptation method.
