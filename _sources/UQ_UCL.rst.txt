    The present report draws a concise review of uncertainty quantificat ion methods classified according to their intrusiveness. Attentions is paid to non -intrusive and later semi -intrusive methods which enable to define procedures which are independent of the models equations, thus enabling full separation of concern. The rep ort also presents up-to-date toolkits, libraries and pieces of software that enable the high -throughput ensemble -based computations required for verification, validation and uncertainty quantification.

    This document reports on the process of implementing and applying uncertainty quantification methods to the building blocks of the future NEPTUNE fusion multiscale model, drawing from collaboration with the EU-funded VECMA project.
