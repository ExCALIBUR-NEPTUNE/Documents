    This report presents the deliverables and findings of the AQUIFER project, focusing on advanced uncertainty quantification in fusion modelling at the Exascale with model order reduction. The project employed techniques such as functional emulation for temperature profile, deep Gaussian processes, gradient-based sequential design, stochastic emulation by heteroscedastic Gaussian processes, and more.
