    This report discusses the challenges of eﬃcient uncertainty quantiﬁcation in modern physical computer models and proposes a non-intrusive reduced order model (ROM) using Gaussian process (GP) surrogates for problems with high dimensional outputs. The method is applied to an anisotropic heat transport problem.
